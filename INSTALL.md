Running beowulf is very simple, thanks to the convenience of Python and Pygame - both of which you'll need,

* [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) version 3.30 recommended
* [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

After that, run main.py like you would any binary. 

On Unixen and Unix-like:
```bash
$ ./main.py
```
If you get a permission denied error:
```bash
$ chmod 754 main.py
```
